This project evaluates the run-time speed of BLAS and SparseBLAS libraries, in
  the context of Product Quantization (and its variants).

In Product Quantization (and its variants), the pre-computation stage involves
  the pre-computation of inner product with each codeword in the codebooks. This
  can be accelerated by the BLAS library, since it is intrinsically a matrix
  multiplication.

In Sparse Composite Quantization, the pre-computation is accelerated by imposing
  a sparsity constraint on the codewords. After this, SparseBLAS can be adopted
  to speed-up the inner product pre-computation.

This project aims at comparing the wall-time consumption of the pre-computation
  stage in PQ, CKM/OPQ, CQ/AQ, and SCQ. TQ may also be included in the future.
