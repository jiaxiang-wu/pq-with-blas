This project evaluates the run-time speed of MKL library (BLAS & SparseBLAS),
  in the context of Product Quantization (and its variants).

In Product Quantization (and its variants), the pre-computation stage involves
  the computation of inner product with each codeword in the codebooks. This
  can be accelerated by the BLAS library, since it is intrinsically a matrix
  multiplication process.

In Sparse Composite Quantization, the pre-computation is accelerated by imposing
  a sparsity constraint on the codewords. After this, SparseBLAS can be adopted
  to speed-up the inner product pre-computation.

In Tree Quantization, a structured sparsity constraint is also introduced (Each
  dimension is shared by exactly two codebooks). SparseBLAS can also be used to 
  speed-up the computation of inner products.

This project aims at comparing the wall-time consumption of the pre-computation
  stage in PQ, OPQ/CKM, CQ/AQ, SCQ and TQ under various parameter settings.

Note:
1. We report the pre-computation time (in millisecond) of each query (average
     over 10k queries). Two input settings are evaluated, "single query" and 
     "multiple queries" (50 queries in a batch).
2. The time consumption is measured on a workstation, equiped with Intel(R)
     Xeon(R) E5-2640 CPU @ 2.50GHz, single-threaded. The reported time may not
     be accurate, since other jobs were also running during the experiments.
3. OPQ/CKM and CQ/AQ are basically the same during the pre-computation stage,
     thus only one is reported for each pair.
